You are the newest member of Automatidataâ€™s data analytics team. Your team is close to completing their project for the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC). Previously, you completed a project proposal and used Python to explore and analyze the TLC dataset, create data visualizations, and conduct an A/B test. Most recently, you built an MLR model for fare amounts based on a variety of variables. 

The New York City TLC is impressed with your work so far. Now, they want your team to identify which variables or factors influence the amount of gratuity a rider gives a driver. Your work will help TLC stakeholders make informed business decisions that will increase gratuities and subsequently improve driver satisfaction. 

At a meeting with New York City TLC stakeholders, your team suggests building a random forest model to predict whether or not a rider will be a generous tipper (>= 20%). At the end of the meeting, Titus Nelson, the Operations Manager at the New York City TLC, says that he will share the suggestion with his organization's leadership team. 

A few days after the meeting, you receive an email from Juliana Soto, a Department Head at the New York City TLC. Juliana says that TLC leadership likes the idea of using a random forest model to predict gratuity and asks the team to share more details about the model. You also receive a follow-up email from Udo Bankole, the Director of Data Analysis at Automatidata. Udo asks you to build the random forest model and to prepare an executive summary to share your results.
